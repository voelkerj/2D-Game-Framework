Box2d-lite Main Loop
1) Setup new ImGui frame
2) Draw all text
3) world.step 
 3a) if dt is positive, calculate inverse time
 3b) Broadphase
 3c) Integrate bodies velocity and angular velocity
     - This uses force and torque
  3c1) If body has inverse mass of 0, then do not integrate
 3d) Loop through all arbiters (collisions)
  3d1) Pre-step
        - Loop through each contact
         - Calculate a bunch of intermediate variables
 3e) Loop through all joints
  3e1) Pre-step 
        - Calculate a bunch of intermediate variables
 3f) Perform iterations (const of 10 in main.cpp)
  3f1) Loop through each arbiter, apply impulse
        - For each contact
         - Calculate r1, r2, relative velocity (normal), normal impulse
         - Check if accumulation is on, do different clamping depending on answer
         - Apply impulse to contact
         - Calculate velocities and angular velocities of bodies
         - Calculate relative velocity (tangent), tangent impulse
         - Check if accumulation is on, do different clamping depending on answer
         - Calculate velocities and angular velocities of bodies
  3f2) Loop through each joint, apply impulse
        - Calculate relative velocity
        - Calculate and apply impulse
 3g) Calculate new position of each body using timestep and velocity
4) Draw all bodies, contacts, etc.
