Entities
add float friction member
add inverse mass member

Collision
add float friction member
friction = sqrt(A.friction * B.friction)
consider instead of storing two entity names, create a "key" variable using the names

Do I need something like a "contact" class?
-seems like this is needed for warm starting

Box2d-lite Main Loop
1) Setup new ImGui frame
2) Draw all text
3) world.step 
 3a) if dt is positive, calculate inverse time
 3b) Broadphase
 3c) Integrate bodies velocity and angular velocity
  3c1) If body has inverse mass of 0, then do not integrate
 3d) Loop through all arbiters (collisions)
  3d1) Pre-step
        - Loop through each contact
         - Calculate a bunch of intermediate variables
 3e) Loop through all joints
  3e1) Pre-step 
        - Calculate a bunch of intermediate variables
 3f) Perform iterations (const of 10 in main.cpp)
  3f1) Loop through each arbiter, apply impulse
        - For each contact
  3f2) Loop through each joint, apply impulse
